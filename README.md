# Install integration

This integration is distributed using [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/).
Alternatively you can install it manually by copying the contents of `custom_components/xmrig/` to `<your config dir>/custom_components/xmrig/`.

# Setup integration

Add new XMRIG instance configuring name, address and (opion) access token.
It's not possible to add one server twice.
